      I am very excited to introduce smartXchange's newest feature: Board. Board is a place where everyone in the smartXchange community can
      post and view posts about potential language exchange meetups, your projects (such as Kickstarter projects), links to your work (such as art, design, development),
      and potential jobs / work you have to offer. You can also upvote or downvote a post (making someone's or your own post more popular), comment on a post,
      and follow a post so that you receive all notifications for that post. You are limited to 5 posts, 10 votes, and 10 comments per 24 hour period :).
      If you have doubts on how to use the Board, check out the 5min <a href="<%= @url_board_tutorial %>">smartXchange board tutorial</a>

      Other new features: A much improved mobile feel, every page is now mobile friendly so the website can be easily used on a smartphone or tablet. A smartXchange mobile tutorial
      will be coming soon :). We also improved speed and security by making database queries (searches) faster and safer, with less queries performed for the same action and more security checks.
      Lastly, we added the ability to display links on your profile (in the title/profession section) and added time zone localization with time now displayed in your local time zone.
